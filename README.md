# INET 4031 Geometry Application

This is a simple Flask web application that calculates the volumes of basic geometric shapes. It was created for the INET 4031 Intro to Systems course to practice Python programming, Flask routing, HTML templating, and unit testing.

## What It Does
- Lets the user pick a shape (cylinder or sphere)

- Shows a form where the user enters the radius (and height for cylinders)

- Calculates the volume and displays the result

- Includes unit tests to check that the math functions work correctly

## What Was Learned

- How to build a basic Flask web app and connect routes to HTML pages

- How to pass form data from HTML into Python

- How to organize code into templates and separate Python files

- How to write simple unit tests using Python’s unittest

- How to push a project to GitHub with a .gitignore
