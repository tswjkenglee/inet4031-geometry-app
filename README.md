# INET 4031 Geometry Application

This is a simple Flask web application that calculates the volumes of basic geometric shapes. It was created for the INET 4031 Intro to Systems course to practice Python programming, Flask routing, HTML templating, and unit testing.

## What It Does
- Lets the user pick a shape (cylinder or sphere)

- Shows a form where the user enters the radius (and height for cylinders)

- Calculates the volume and displays the result

- Includes unit tests to check that the math functions work correctly

## What Was Learned

During this Lab I learned how Flask works and how a web app connects Python code to HTML pages using routes and templates. I learned how to send form data from the browser to Python functions and displaying results back to the user. I also learned how to separate code into different files, write unit tests using Python’s unittest module, and verify that my functions were calculating the correct values. On the GitHub side, I learned how to create a repository with a proper .gitignore and understand how applications can run both locally and inside containers on a VM.
